The Sliding Window Function for Time Series Cross Validation 
The sliding window function was created to validate time series models using sequenced timestamped data that iterates 1 day over a period of 365 days, creating test windows and subsequent forecast models based on the time window. This is a proven and efficient cross validation methodology. Then use Facebook Prophet to develop a time series model to test the functionality of the validation method.
